# CurrencyExchangeRate
Microsoft Excel Project

# ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Choco group requires a robust and user-friendly Microsoft Excel-based solution to effectively monitor and analyze real-time foreign exchange (forex) rates. Leveraging data from Yahoo Finance, the solution should facilitate informed decision-making by providing up-to-date currency exchange information

# ðŸ“Š Methodology
  â€¢ I established a connection with yahoo finance website to get the market currencies exchange rate data

  â€¢ I ensured proper data formats using the power query editor before loading the table into the excel workbook 

  â€¢ I enabled data refresh every 5 minutes to ensure current data 

  â€¢ I used conditional formatting to highlight positive (green), negative(red) and no(yellow) rate changes.

# ðŸš€ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Identify the top 5 gaining and losing currency pairs based on Change %.
  â€¢ Using the top/bottom conditional formatting rule as at the time of recording;

  â€¢  Top 5 gaining currency pairs: EUR/USD, AUD/USD, NZD/USD, EUR/GBP, EUR/HUF

  â€¢  Top 5 losing currency pairs: USD/JPY, GBP/JPY, EUR/CHF, USD/SGD, USD/MXN

#### Rank currency pairs by highest and lowest exchange rates.
  â€¢ I created a new column called Rank and used the RANK.EQ function to rank based on change %

  â€¢ Highest exchange rate currency pair: EUR/USD

  â€¢ Lowest exchange rate currency pair: USD/JPY

#### Getting the average price change of all currency pairs.
  Using the AVERAGE function, the average price change at the point of recording was -0.08128
